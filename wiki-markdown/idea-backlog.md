## Dr Justin’s App Stack

As a tech-oriented person, I have experimented with using virtually every popular productivity app out there. This is my current stack that I have installed on my devices, or have used in the past to great effect.

Unfortunately, it would take hours to go through exactly how I have set them all up and integrated them with each other to make it flow seamlessly, but part of the process is seeing what works for you and doing some tinkering.

For beginners, all you need is an app for task management and prioritisation, and a calendar app for scheduling. Don’t get intimidated by my list.

Task Management and Prioritisation

[Asana](https://asana.com) or [Amazing Marvin](https://amazingmarvin.com)  
I currently use Amazing Marvin as it is extremely powerful and **easily** the most customisable and fully featured. It is also the most research-based and is the only app I have found that can keep up with the level of optimisation I strive for, but it can be overwhelming for beginners. It may also be excessive for those who aren’t productivity maniacs or have lots of tasks to prioritise.  
  
On the other hand, Asana has a free plan that is excellent for task management. I used Asana for years before switching to Amazing Marvin and would still happily use it again if I needed to.  
  
Notion is commonly used for task management, but it is very unoptimised and falls far, far, far behind both Asana or Amazing Marvin.

Ideas Collection, High-Level Project Management and “Second Brain”

[Notion](https://notion.so) – it requires a bit of set-up but is currently the best way to store ideas. If you don’t have lots going on though (I typically have around 20-30 projects, 200+ tasks and potentially unknown hundreds of ideas at any given point), you can just use [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/), available on all devices.

Creating Focus and Removing Distractions

I use [BlockSite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-website-blocke/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en) with my students because the settings can be password protected by my email address.  
However, there are many site blockers out there which may be better for you.  
  
Focus timing with 5217 on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franco.timer&hl=en) or [web browser](https://web.5217.app/)  
I have also used [Tide](https://tide.fm/en_US/) (on both Android and iOS).  
  
I currently use [Relaxio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.relaxio.relaxio) for white noise generation – I like the flexibility of being able to create exactly the type of white noise for each situation.  
  
For mindfulness meditation, even though I was trained in meditation from a young age, I still use [Calm](https://calm.com) religiously and have also tried [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/), both are good, though I prefer Calm and still recommend it to my students and clients in the first instance.

Habit Creation and Tracking

[Remente](https://www.remente.com/) is my recommended app due to its feature-set and flexibility, though [Fabulous](https://www.thefabulous.co/) is also fantastic for total beginners.  
  
Some Notion set-ups work, however I feel that the experience is less integrated.

Scheduling and Calendars

I use Google Calendars as a base because of its ability to cross-synchronise across virtually every calendar service.  
  
On my phone, I use [Business Calendar 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgenix.bizcal&hl=en) for Android, which I have found to be the most fully-featured and versatile, while also looking good as a widget (which is important to me). New calendar apps are always popping up so there may be better ones out now.  
  
On my Windows devices, I use [OneCalendar](https://www.onecalendar.nl/onecalendar/overview).

Time Tracking

[Boosted](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boostedproductivity.app&hl=en) for Android, [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) for iOS  
  
This doesn’t matter so much – it’s more about finding something that is fast and effective for you. The most important thing is the ability to start and stop tracking with minimal delay. If it takes 20 seconds and 4 taps every time you start tracking, that’s too long and you’ll eventually feel too lazy to track consistently.  
  
Finding an app that is fast (like Boosted) has allowed me to track almost every single day for almost 3 years, after at least 3 previous years of inconsistent tracking with apps that took too long.

One of my non-urgent, important projects is always up-skilling and learning. My specific learning strategy is quite complex, however for interest, I use [Blinkist](https://blinkist.com), [Audible](https://audible.com), podcasts, and physical books in simultaneous combination.
